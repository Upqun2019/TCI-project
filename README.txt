The theory of temporal compressive high-speed imaging is studied and realized.
In this code project, two algorithms, including Two-step Iterative-Shrinkage Thresholding (TwIST) algorithm and Gaussian Mixture Model(GMM) algorithm, are used to reconstruct measurements. 
In addition, these two algorithms are modified by connected with Wiener algorithm. 
To be specific, the reconstruction results of Wiener algorithm is respectively used to be the initial value in TwIST iteration process and the video data to train the GMM model in GMM algorithm. 
Eventually, it is proved that the two modified algorithms perform better.
